    Your post is missing the coordinates or glyphs.  You can add the coordinates as a reply to this comment. Glyphs can be included in a screenshot. Coordinates can be found by placing a signal booster on any planet. The first 4 characters displayed are not part of the coordinates. You can capture the glyph from a screenshot. To convert them to coordinates you can type in [use](https://glyphs.blackholesuns.com). Please remember all finds posted to r/{{subreddit}} must have coordinates.

    All starships in a given system can be found at the Space Station AND at any Trade Post located within the system. The same ships are available on all platforms and game modes. Things to check if you don't find the item you're looking for. 1) Are you in the correct galaxy. 2) Are you in the correct system. It's very easy to enter the glyphs incorrectly so double check your location.

    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been marked for moderator review. We're trying to keep confusing and misleading information give to new users to a minimum. Thank you for helping us with this.

    *The class of a ship and its exact slot count are only valid for a *crashed* ship. For any other ship location it's based on the individual ship that gets spawned so should NOT be included.
    *Freighter class and slot counts are also based on spawning so should NOT be included.

    **Please**, repost your find keeping these things in mind. 

    For a more detailed explanation please read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/g6kb2j/psa_basic_recommendations_to_avoid_confusion_when/)

    How to find **Freighters** using member submitted coordinates: 

    **System Freighters** (15-19 inventory slots) can be found by traveling via portal using the coordinates provided in this post. #Once you are in the right system, pulse around in space until the correct system freighter spawns.

    **Capital Freighters** (24-34 inventory slots) are slightly more complex to find using member submitted coordinates. See [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/cz937n/psa_how_to_get_a_cap_ship_via_coords/) for more information.
