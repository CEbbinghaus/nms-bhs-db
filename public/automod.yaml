    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been marked for moderator review. We're trying to keep confusing and misleading information give to new users to a minimum. Thank you for helping us with this.

    *The class of a ship and its exact slot count are only valid for a *crashed* ship. For any other ship location it's based on the individual ship that gets spawned so should NOT be included.
    *Freighter class and slot counts are also based on spawning so should NOT be included.

    **Please**, repost your find keeping these things in mind. 

    For a more detailed explanation please read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/g6kb2j/psa_basic_recommendations_to_avoid_confusion_when/)

    How to find **Freighters** using member submitted coordinates: 

    **System Freighters** (15-19 inventory slots) can be found by traveling via portal using the coordinates provided in this post. #Once you are in the right system, pulse around in space until the correct system freighter spawns.

    **Capital Freighters** (24-34 inventory slots) are slightly more complex to find using member submitted coordinates. See [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/cz937n/psa_how_to_get_a_cap_ship_via_coords/) for more information.
