    The portal address for the system only uses the first 2 glyphs out of 16. So, if you have a new save and have only learned part of the glyphs, at least the first 2, you can still get this ship.

    Please add the **missing** information to your post. You can edit the flair to add galaxy, platform & mode after the post is made. e.g. "Base/Euclid/PC/Normal"  
    Coordinates can be included in the screenshot or typed in as coordinates. You can convert glyphs to coordinates [here](https://glyphs.blackholesuns.com). Please remember to include the galaxy, game mode and platform in the flair and glyphs in the screenshot of your future base or farm post. Thanks.

    Your post is missing the coordinates or glyphs.  You can add the coordinates as a reply to this comment. Coordinates can be found by placing a signal booster on any planet. The first 4 characters displayed are not part of the coordinates. You can capture the glyph in a screenshot and convert them to coordinates you can type in [here](https://glyphs.blackholesuns.com). For future post the glyphs can be included in the screenshot. Please remember all finds posted to r/{{subreddit}} must have the coordinates or glyphs.

    All starships in a given system can be found at the Space Station AND at any Trade Post located within the system. The same ships are available on all platforms and game modes. Things to check if you don't find the item you're looking for. 1) Are you in the correct galaxy. 2) Are you in the correct system. It's very easy to enter the glyphs incorrectly so please double check your location.

    Each individually spawned ship has a random class & number of slots. In a T3, wealthy, system a ship has a 2% chance of spawning as an S class. The range of slots is based on the configuration of the ship. An S class ship will have the max possible number of slots in it's range. Only crashed ships have a fixed configuration of size and class.

    The first glyph of a portal address is the planet index. If you are going to pick up a ship then this character doesn't matter. It is usually given as 0 which will take you to the first planet in a system. For other items the glyph given should take you to the correct planet. The remaining 11 digits are the system address. If it seems you aren't in the right place please check the address by comparing with the address in your screenshot. It's very easy to misenter a glyph address. Remember if the first glyph is 0 then you'll actually be on planet 1 and that is what the screenshot will show. If it still doesn't look right double check your current galaxy to make sure you're where the item is posted. For items like bases check to make sure you're on the right platform.

    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been marked for moderator review. We're trying to keep confusing and misleading information give to new users to a minimum. Thank you for helping us with this.

    *The class of a ship and its exact slot count are only valid for a *crashed* ship. For any other ship location it's based on the individual ship that gets spawned so should NOT be included.
    *Freighter class and slot counts are also based on spawning so should NOT be included.

    **Please**, repost your find keeping these things in mind.

    How to find **Freighters** using member submitted coordinates: 

    **System Freighters** (15-19 inventory slots) can be found by traveling via portal using the coordinates provided in this post. #Once you are in the right system, pulse around in space until the correct system freighter spawns.

    **Capital Freighters** (24-34 inventory slots) are slightly more complex to find using member submitted coordinates. See [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/cz937n/psa_how_to_get_a_cap_ship_via_coords/) for more information.
