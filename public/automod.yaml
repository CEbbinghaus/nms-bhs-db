    This system only uses the first 2 glyphs found. The first character is the planet index. So if you haven't found the glyph used for the planet index portal to the system using 0 or 1 and then fly to the indicated planet.

    Your post needs the galaxy to be complete. You can edit the flair to include the galaxy after the post is made. e.g. "Starship/Euclid". Please remember that all finds posted to r/{{subreddit}} must have the galaxy. Thanks.

    Your post is missing the coordinates or glyphs.  For this post you can add the coordinates as comment. **Please** remember all finds posted to r/{{subreddit}} must have the coordinates or glyphs.

    *Videos must have the coordinates or glyphs included in the title or first frame of the video.

    Coordinates can be found by placing a signal booster on any planet. The first 4 characters displayed are not part of the coordinates. You can capture the glyph in a screenshot and convert them to coordinates you can type in [here](https://glyphs.blackholesuns.com). For future post the glyphs can be included in the screenshot.

    All starships in a given system can be found at the Space Station AND at any Trade Post located within the system. The same ships are available on all platforms and game modes. Things to check if you don't find the item you're looking for. 1) Are you in the correct galaxy. 2) Are you in the correct system. It's very easy to enter the glyphs incorrectly so please double check your location.

    Each individually spawned ship has a random class & number of slots. In a T3, wealthy, system a ship has a 2% chance of spawning as an S class. The range of slots is based on the configuration of the ship. An S class ship will have the max possible number of slots in it's range. Only crashed ships have a fixed configuration of size and class.

    The first glyph of a portal address is the planet index. If you are going to pick up a ship then this character doesn't matter. It is usually given as 0 which will take you to the first planet in a system. For other items the glyph given should take you to the correct planet. The remaining 11 digits are the system address. If it seems you aren't in the right place please check the address by comparing with the address in your screenshot. It's very easy to misenter a glyph address. Remember if the first glyph is 0 then you'll actually be on planet 1 and that is what the screenshot will show. If it still doesn't look right double check your current galaxy to make sure you're where the item is posted. For items like bases check to make sure you're on the right platform and game mode.

    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been removed because we're trying to keep confusing and misleading information give to new users to a minimum. Thank you for helping us with this.

    *The class of a ship and its exact slot count are only valid for a *crashed* ship. For any other ship location it's based on the individual ship that gets spawned so should NOT be included.
    *Freighter class and slot counts are also based on spawning so should NOT be included.

    **Please**, repost your {{match-flair_text}} keeping this in mind.

    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been set for moderator review because we're trying to keep confusing and misleading information given to new users to a minimum. Thank you for your help with this.

    *Ships are found across the entire system so please do not include traders post or space station in your description unless it's a first wave at a space station. First wave is only valid at a space station and is the first group of ships, usually 4, to land after a reload or reset. Later waves should not be mentioned.
    
    **Please**, repost your {{match-flair_text}} keeping this in mind.

    Thank You for posting to /r/{{subreddit}} and adding this **{{match}}** to our catalogue!

    How to find **Freighters** using member submitted coordinates: 

    **System Freighters** (15-19 inventory slots) can be found by traveling via portal using the coordinates provided in this post. Once you are in the right system, pulse around in space until the correct system freighter spawns.

    **Capital Freighters** (24-34 inventory slots) are slightly more complex to find using member submitted coordinates. See [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/cz937n/psa_how_to_get_a_cap_ship_via_coords/) for more information.
